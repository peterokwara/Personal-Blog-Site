            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
            dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
            pleasure of the moment,
            <em
              >so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
              trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those
              who fail in their duty through weakness of will</em
            >, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
            These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free
            hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
            prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
            to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances
            and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it
            will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
            annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
            matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
            secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid
            worse pains. At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos
            ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque
            corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati
            cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia
            deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum
            quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore,
            cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus
            id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda
            est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut
            officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et
            voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque
            earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis
            voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus
            asperiores repellat. But I must explain to you how all this mistaken
            idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
            give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
            teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of
            human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
            itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know
            how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
            extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or
            desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
            occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure
            him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever
            undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
            advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
            who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
            or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? Sed ut

                Dolores is first introduced as a rancher's daughter living near
                Sweetwater. It is soon revealed that she is the oldest host in
                the park, having taken many roles over the course of around 30
                years. Because she was the first functional host, all other
                hosts are based on her. Her body has been reprinted and upgraded
                several times so that she seems new to the guests. She had a
                very special connection to her creator, Arnold, who saw Dolores
                as a human rather than a host. He was confident that Dolores
                would find her way to the center of her maze, which was Arnold's
                analogy for gaining consciousness, which she did. However, when
                Robert Ford refused to cancel the park's opening, Arnold
                programmed the personality Wyatt into Dolores, so that she would
                slaughter all the hosts in the park, then Arnold had her kill
                him in hopes that it would prevent the park from opening.
